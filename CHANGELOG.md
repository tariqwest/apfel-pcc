## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- Removed the `apfel tag` subcommand. It was feature creep - apfel is the UNIX tool (`apfel "prompt"`) and the OpenAI-compatible server (`apfel --serve`); a content-tagging command is a different tool. On-device content tagging now lives in the dedicated sister tool [apfel-tag](https://github.com/Arthur-Ficial/apfel-tag): `brew install tariqwest/tap/apfel-plus-tag`.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- `apfel demos [dir]` writes the bundled demo scripts (cmd, explain, oneliner, wtd, naming, port, gitsum, mac-narrator) to a directory. The demos are embedded in the binary, so it behaves identically on homebrew-core, the tap, and source builds (#204).

### Changed

- CHANGELOG.md is now backfilled through every release and kept current automatically by the release workflow (#201).

### Fixed

- Tap formula keeps its macOS-only guard: silence the `Homebrew/OSDependsOn` style warning without dropping `depends_on :macos`, which is the only hard Linux block for the prebuilt-binary tap (#203).

## [1.5.5] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- Handle function-name string tool calls (#200).

## [1.5.4] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

- Zero-touch nixpkgs distribution via r-ryantm + merge bot.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- Strict context strategy no longer duplicates the final prompt.
- Support the standard `--` end-of-options separator.
- Blank line in MCP reader leftover no longer stalls into a timeout.

### Fixed

- Repair unclosed bracket in model tool call JSON (#187).

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-01

### Removed

- Removed the `apfel tag` subcommand - feature creep, moved to sister tool [https://github.com/Arthur-Ficial/apfel-tag](https://github.com/Arthur-Ficial/apfel-tag).

- Fallback token counter counts tool definitions and tool-call args (#176).
- Unknown `GenerationError` case classifies to `.unknown`, not a locale keyword guess (#181).
- `SchemaParser` throws on non-dictionary property schema instead of silently dropping it (#180).
- Env vars and `--retry` enforce the same validation as their flags (#177).
- `JSONFenceStripper.strip` returns trimmed content when no fence present (#183).
