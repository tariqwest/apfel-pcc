# OpenAI API Compatibility

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:11434/v1`

`apfel-plus` implements the OpenAI Chat Completions surface for Apple's on-device model. It is intended to be a drop-in local backend for SDKs and tools that can target a custom `base_url`.

`apfel` implements the OpenAI Chat Completions and Responses surfaces for Apple's on-device model: a drop-in local backend for SDKs and tools that target a custom `base_url`.

## Supported Surface

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | Supported | Streaming + non-streaming |
| `POST /v1/responses` | Supported | See [Responses API](#responses-api) below |
| `GET /v1/models` | Supported | Returns `apple-foundationmodel` |
| `GET /health` | Supported | Model availability, context window, languages |
| `GET /v1/logs`, `/v1/logs/stats` | Debug only | Requires `--debug` |
| Tool calling | Supported | Native `ToolDefinition` + JSON detection. See [tool-calling-guide.md](tool-calling-guide.md) |
| `response_format: json_object` | Supported | System-prompt injection; markdown fences stripped from output |
| `response_format: json_schema` | Supported | Guaranteed schema-conforming output via FoundationModels `DynamicGenerationSchema`; works with `stream: true` |
| `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`, `seed` | Supported | Mapped to `GenerationOptions`. `top_p` is nucleus sampling; `temperature: 0` maps to greedy (deterministic). Omitting `max_tokens` uses the remaining context window (drop-in OpenAI semantics; see Notes) |
| `stream: true` | Supported | SSE; final usage chunk only when `stream_options: {"include_usage": true}` (per OpenAI spec) |
| `stream_options.include_usage` | Supported | Opt-in for the empty-`choices` usage chunk before `[DONE]` |
| `finish_reason` | Supported | `stop`, `tool_calls`, `length` |
| Context strategies | Supported | `x_context_strategy`, `x_context_max_turns`, `x_context_output_reserve` extension fields |
| CORS | Supported | Enable with `--cors` |
| `POST /v1/completions` | 501 | Legacy text completions not supported |
| `POST /v1/embeddings` | 501 | Embeddings not available on-device |
| `logprobs=true`, `n>1`, `stop`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty` | 400 | Rejected explicitly. `n=1` and `logprobs=false` are accepted as no-ops |
| Multi-modal (images) | 400 | Rejected with clear error |
| `Authorization` header | Supported | Required when `--token` is set. See [server-security.md](server-security.md) |

## Responses API

`POST /v1/responses` is served as a translation layer over the same on-device pipeline as Chat Completions. apfel is stateless; the Responses API's server-side conversation state is deliberately not implemented.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `input` as a string or message list | Supported | Roles `system`, `developer` (folded into system), `user`, `assistant`; string content or `input_text` parts |
| `instructions` | Supported | Becomes the system prompt |
| `stream: true` | Supported | Canonical event sequence: `response.created` ... `response.output_text.delta` ... `response.completed`, with `sequence_number` |
| `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_output_tokens`, `metadata` | Supported | Same semantics as chat; metadata echoed back |
| `text.format: json_object` / `json_schema` | Supported | json_schema is non-streaming only (501 with `stream: true`) |
| Function tools (flat Responses shape) | Supported | Non-streaming only; the call comes back as a `function_call` output item for the client to execute |
| `usage` | Supported | `input_tokens` / `output_tokens` / `total_tokens` |
| `previous_response_id` | 501 | apfel is stateless: resend the full conversation in `input` |
| `store: true` | 501 | Responses are never stored; every response reports `"store": false` |
| `background`, `reasoning`, `include` | 501 | Not available on-device |
| Hosted tools (`web_search`, `file_search`, `computer_use`, ...) | 501 | The on-device model has no hosted tools |
| `function_call_output` input items | 501 | Tool-result round-trips are not yet supported on this endpoint; use Chat Completions |

MCP tools attached with `--mcp` are auto-executed on Chat Completions only; `/v1/responses` serves client-defined function tools.

## Notes

- `GET /health` stays useful for local availability checks even when the rest of the server is token-protected, if you opt into `--public-health`.
- Debug log endpoints exist only when the server is started with `--debug`.
- Browser access, origin checks, bearer tokens, and `--footgun` behavior are documented in [server-security.md](server-security.md).
- **`max_tokens` omitted = use the remaining context window** (4096 tokens on macOS 26, 8192 on macOS 27 - read at runtime; drop-in OpenAI semantics). If the model runs into the ceiling, the response ends cleanly with `finish_reason: "length"` and the partial content is returned (HTTP 200). Pass `max_tokens` explicitly when you want a tighter latency budget or a known cap. Full rationale and examples in [README.md](../README.md#default-response-cap-max_tokens).
