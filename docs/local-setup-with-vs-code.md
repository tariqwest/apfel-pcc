# Local Setup with Visual Studio Code

The shape of the setup is:

1. Run `apfel-plus --serve` as a local OpenAI-compatible server.
2. Use the Continue extension in Visual Studio Code.
3. Route **chat/code review** to local `apfel-plus`.
4. Route **edit/apply** to a second model.
5. Keep `~/.continue/.env` in sync from the shell so Continue can read `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

For the underlying API contract, see [openai-api-compatibility.md](openai-api-compatibility.md) and [server-security.md](server-security.md).

## 1. Start `apfel-plus` as the local server

Use `apfel-plus` as the local OpenAI-compatible base URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1
```

Start it in the foreground:

```bash
apfel-plus --serve
```

Or run it in the background:

```bash
brew services start apfel-plus
```

Background-service details: [background-service.md](background-service.md)

<<<<<<< HEAD
Important: use **Chat Completions**, not the newer Responses API. `apfel-plus` supports `POST /v1/chat/completions` and does not implement `POST /v1/responses`.
=======
Important: this setup uses **Chat Completions** (`POST /v1/chat/completions`), which is what Continue's `openai` provider speaks. apfel also implements the newer Responses API (`POST /v1/responses`), but Continue does not use it here.

## 2. Install the Continue extension in Visual Studio Code

Use Continue as the Visual Studio Code front end.

Continue reads configuration from:

- `~/.continue/config.yaml`
- `~/.continue/.env`

## 3. Configure Continue with two models

Use local `apfel-plus` for safer chat/review work and a second model for edit/apply.

Create or replace `~/.continue/config.yaml` with:

```yaml
name: Apfel Review + OpenAI Apply
version: 0.0.1
schema: v1

models:
  - name: apfel-plus-review
    provider: openai
    model: apple-foundationmodel
    apiBase: http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1
    apiKey: ignored
    roles:
      - chat
    contextLength: 4096
    defaultCompletionOptions:
      temperature: 0.0
      maxTokens: 256
    requestOptions:
      extraBodyProperties:
        x_context_output_reserve: 256
    chatOptions:
      baseSystemMessage: |
        You are a code review assistant.
        Prioritize bugs, regressions, edge cases, security risks, and missing tests.
        Give findings first and be concrete.

  - name: gpt-5.1-apply
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-5.1
    apiKey: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
    roles:
      - edit
      - apply
    defaultCompletionOptions:
      temperature: 0.0
      maxTokens: 1200

context:
  - provider: diff
  - provider: file
```

Why this split works:

- `apfel-plus-review` is restricted to `chat`, so it becomes the local review lane.
- `gpt-5.1-apply` handles `edit` and `apply`, where a stronger hosted model is more useful.
- `temperature: 0.0` keeps both lanes deterministic.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- `contextLength: 4096` matches `apfel-plus`'s local context budget.

- `contextLength: 4096` matches `apfel`'s local context budget on macOS 26; on macOS 27 the on-device window is 8192 (`apfel --model-info` prints the live value).

## 4. Provide `OPENAI_API_KEY` to Continue

Continue reads secrets from `~/.continue/.env`.

The direct manual version is:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

But in our setup, we also wired this into the shell so Continue's `.env` file is updated automatically from the existing Codex login helpers in `~/.zshrc`. (See: [Leveraging multiple, repository-specific OpenAI Codex API Keys with Visual Studio Code on macOS](https://snelson.us/2026/04/many-to-one-api-keys/).)

## 5. Sync `~/.continue/.env` automatically from `~/.zshrc`

Inside the `# --- OpenAI Codex: Start` / `# --- OpenAI Codex: End` block in `~/.zshrc`, we added helpers so that:

- `cli` logs Codex in and writes `OPENAI_API_KEY=...` to `~/.continue/.env`
- `clo` logs Codex out and removes only the `OPENAI_API_KEY` line from `~/.continue/.env`

This keeps the Continue secret in step with your Codex/OpenAI shell workflow without manual edits. Your typical flow becomes:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
cli
```

When you are done with the Visual Studio Code session:

```bash
clo
```

## 6. Restart Visual Studio Code after auth changes

After changing auth state, reload Visual Studio Code's extension host so Continue picks up the current environment and config.

Use:

```text
Cmd + Shift + P -> Developer: Restart Extension Host
```

## 7. Recommended day-to-day usage

Use local `apfel-plus` for:

- review the current diff
- review the selected function
- summarize a file before editing
- identify likely regressions
- point out missing tests

Use the hosted edit/apply model for:

- targeted code changes
- apply/fix flows
- rewriting a selected block
- generating a patch after review findings are clear

This is the important habit: keep `apfel-plus` focused on **small review contexts**. It works best on a diff, one file, or one selected region, not giant repo-wide prompts.

## 8. Typical workflow

1. Start `apfel-plus` with `apfel-plus --serve` or `brew services start apfel-plus`.
2. Open Visual Studio Code.
3. Run `cli` in your shell to authenticate Codex and update `~/.continue/.env`.
4. Restart the Visual Studio Code extension host.
5. Ask Continue chat to review the current diff or selected code using the local `apfel-plus-review` model.
6. Once the review is clear, use Edit/Apply to hand the actual code change to the hosted `gpt-5.1-apply` model.
7. Run `clo` when you are done to clear the shell key and remove `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `~/.continue/.env`.

## 9. Troubleshooting

If Continue cannot talk to local `apfel-plus`:

- make sure `apfel-plus --serve` is running
- confirm the base URL is `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`
- confirm the model name is `apple-foundationmodel`
- make sure the client is pointed at Chat Completions (`/v1/chat/completions`)

If Continue cannot use the hosted edit/apply model:

- check that `~/.continue/.env` contains `OPENAI_API_KEY=...`
- run `cli` again after reloading `~/.zshrc`
- restart the Visual Studio Code extension host

If you need a browser client instead of Continue:

- use `apfel-plus --serve --cors --allowed-origins "<your local origin>"`
