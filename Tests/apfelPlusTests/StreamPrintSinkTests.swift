// StreamPrintSinkTests.swift — #182: a retryable error mid-stream must not
// reprint already-streamed output.
//
// StreamPrintSink is the seam that decouples the print side-effect from the
// retried streaming operation. These tests simulate the cumulative-snapshot
// sequence a streaming model emits, including a retry that re-streams an
// already-printed prefix from scratch, and assert every character is emitted
// exactly once, in order.
