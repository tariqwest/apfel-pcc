"""
apfel Integration Tests - release pipeline wiring (static, model-free).

These tests assert structural facts about the release scripts and CI so a
regression in the release plumbing is caught without cutting a real release.

Covered:
- #269: previous-tag selection must use a fixed-string, whole-line filter
  (`grep -Fxv`) so re-publishing vX.Y.Z when vX.Y.Z0+ exists does not filter
  those tags out of the release-notes commit range.
- #225: the divergent `workflow_dispatch` release path (publish-release.yml)
  must not exist - CLAUDE.md mandates local releases because GitHub-hosted
  runners lack Apple Intelligence, and the stale workflow could publish an
  unqualified release.
