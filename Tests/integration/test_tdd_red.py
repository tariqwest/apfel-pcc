apfel-plus Integration Tests — TDD RED batch (branch tdd/red-tests-167-183)

DELIBERATELY FAILING tests, one per ticket that cannot be reached from the
pure-Swift unit target (see Package.swift: apfel-plus-tests depends only on
ApfelCore + ApfelCLI, so executable-target bugs and server/CLI features are
red-tested here at the wire/CLI boundary).
=======
apfel Integration Tests - regression guards for tickets #167-#183 and #219/#243

These began life as the TDD RED batch (branch tdd/red-tests-167-183). Every
ticket they cover is now FIXED and shipped; the tests are kept as REGRESSION
GUARDS so the behaviour cannot silently regress. They live here (not in the
pure-Swift unit target) because they exercise the wire/CLI boundary of the
FoundationModels-coupled executable target, which apfel-tests cannot import
(see Package.swift: apfel-tests depends only on ApfelCore + ApfelCLI).
>>>>>>> upstream/main

Two kinds of guard:
  - Wire-level behaviour guards (real requests): #167 json_schema, #169 prewarm
    (model-free), #171 streamed structured output, #176 tool-def token count,
    #219 union schemas, #243 fractional number output.
  - Source-level seam pins: where the failure condition is not externally
    triggerable from a client (a mid-stream refusal / retry, an unbounded
    summary), the deterministic coverage lives next to the code and is exercised
    by the pure-Swift unit suite; the guard here pins the source seam so the
    wiring cannot be removed. Covers #168, #175, #179, #182.

Model-dependent tests FAIL rather than skip when the model is absent, consistent
with the project's "never skip" rule. They run under local `make test` /
`make release` where Apple Intelligence is present. #169 and the source-seam
pins are model-free and run anywhere.
