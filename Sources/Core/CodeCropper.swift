// ============================================================================
// CodeCropper.swift — extract the first fenced code block from model output
// Part of ApfelCore — pure Swift, no external dependencies
//
// Backs the CLI `--code` flag (#373): Layer 1 is `steeringDirective` (asks the
// model for exactly one fenced block), Layer 2 is `extract` (guarantees the
// output contract no matter what the model does). Fence recognition follows
// the CommonMark subset specified in #373; the policy decisions (first block
// wins, salvage on unclosed fence, no inline-span heuristics) are locked by
// CodeCropperTests.
