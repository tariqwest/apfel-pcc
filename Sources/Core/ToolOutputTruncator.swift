/// the 4096-token model.
///
/// A large tool result (file reader, web fetch, DB query) fed back verbatim
/// either overflows the context window after the tool already ran (CLI) or is
/// dropped whole by the context trimmer while the prompt still references it
/// (server) - a confident hallucination. This keeps the head and the tail
/// (the two most useful ends) and drops the middle, leaving an explicit marker.

/// The split is character-proportional to the measured tokens-per-character
/// ratio: token counting itself needs the model (root target), so the caller
/// passes in the already-measured `tokenCount` and the derived `budgetTokens`.
